    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I have long been fascinated with data and its profound ability to tell meaningful stories. I have translated that passion and appreciation for data into a career. I am a full-stack web developer with a solid experience in both data analysis and data visualization.
<br>
<br>
    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My career in analytics began at GMHC where I worked with Funding and Programming Departments to analyze our SQL databases and use quantifiable statistics to answer questions like… “Which neighborhoods in NYC experience the highest level of HIV contraction rates?”, or “Are there grants we can apply for to expand our HIV Testing Services?” This work drove me to form an initiative at GMHC to more accurately deploy our mobile health testing vans to neighborhoods they were needed the most. At GMHC I developed the process for staff to access data in an intuitive format and led the reporting of data queries required by the organization.
<br>
<br>

      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I came to realize that my career progression should be able to couple my curiosity for data with my ability to create visual platforms users can use to consume it in an easily intelligible way.  With that goal in mind, I dedicated myself to returning to school and studying web engineering at General Assembly in New York. While learning JavaScript, I fell in love with the D3 visualization library. I found a good marriage between my analytical approach to data and a graphics-driven technology to present it. I also set out to pursue several passion projects to visualize U.S. Census variables including race/ethnicity, income, health insurance coverage, and poverty. I created elegant and detailed charts using cartography tools. I would spend hours exploring the data in this project and hours more refining the code to extract the stories behind the figures. General Assembly taught me the tools I needed to build web interfaces using frameworks and languages such as Node, D3, HTML and CSS, and I continue to build upon these skills.
<br>
<br>

      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp While at NewYork-Presbyterian, I fully developed a React and D3 application while simultaneously collaborating within the Big Data Team to structure the data necessary for real-time patient physiological monitoring. By collaborating with physicians at Columbia and Cornell Medical School, I was able to bring to life my vision of creating a modular framework for presenting clinical patient statuses in a visually informative language that can be quickly evaluated by the practitioner. This innovative product is accessible to all clinical staff at Cornell and Columbia and is used by more than 200 clinicians every month, the majority of users being physicians and medical students. While monitoring user analytics for this application I discovered nearly all our users are young physicians who are used to data being presented through an aesthetically-pleasing and informative interactive experience. Using analytical data of my app’s users, I produced a server-side project to analyze and modify user behavior to increase the utility and impact of my application.
<br>
<br>

      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As you can see from my broad experience, I have a diverse set of technical skills that are necessary to design both applications and graphics projects. I have built interactive visualizations which condense time and visual space to present data to consumers. At the same time, I am curious for the stories between the data points and how those stories are weaved. I have always had an intimate acquaintance with tables and figures; the narrative it weaves has given me the drive to offer audiences the ability to share that insight in a format which is captivating for them.
<br>
<br>

      &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I encourage you to please consider my animated portfolio at <span>linkedin.com/in/gabrielaldana</span> and my visualization website <span>estado.us</span> in addition to the content I have included with my resume.

      Sincerely,
